[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m You will be given a cognitive, creative, logical、mathematical、or planning-related task. Your job is to generate a complete, high-quality response that satisfies the task’s constraints and demonstrates clear, structured reasoning or creativity.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m ### Instructions:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - Carefully read and understand the task.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - Think step by step — break down the task, simulate it mentally if needed, and reason through constraints.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - Then directly write your final response (no need to restate or reformat the task).
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - Do **not** separate your answer into sections like "task", "think", or "response". Just give your best final answer with your reasoning embedded naturally or implied by structure.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - Your output should:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m   * Be **correct** or **plausibly optimal**, given the task
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m   * **Fulfill all constraints** in the task
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m   * Be **clear, structured**, and **non-trivial**
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m   * Avoid fluff, vagueness, or randomness

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m Consider the following criteria when evaluating:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - **Correctness and Accuracy**: The provided Python script generally meets the requirements, correctly identifying Pythagorean triplets, right-angled, and isosceles triangles. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the classification of isosceles right-angled triangles within the `is_triangle` function, as it incorrectly returns 'Isosceles Right' for (2, 2, 4) instead of recognizing it's not a valid right-angled triangle scenario due to the initial problem constraints.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - **Completeness and Addressing the Question**: The script covers all asked functionalities but fails to accurately handle the isosceles right-angled case as per the detailed constraints, leading to a partial fulfillment of the requirements.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - **Structure and Clarity**: The code is well-structured, readable, and clear, with appropriate comments. However, the logic for handling isosceles right-angled triangles in both functions could be refined for better alignment with the question's intents.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - **Strengths**: The use of Python's built-in `math` module for square root calculation is efficient, and the sorting approach in `is_triangle` for determining the triangle type is straightforward.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - **Weaknesses**: The primary weakness lies in the inconsistent handling of isosceles right-angled triangles, which does not fully comply with the question's detailed specifications.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m    - BY THE END OF THE WEEK, SPRING'S PROGRESSION MEANS THESE DAYS BECOME SLIGHTLY LONGER THAN THE MEAN OF THE MONTH BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY SO THAT WINTER-LIKE NIGHTS (WHICH PERSIST UNTIL MID- TO LATE-MARCH).

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m THEREFORE, THE RATIONALE ULTIMATELY POINTS OUT THAT DESPITE THE INITIAL INCREASE IN DAYLIGHT DUE TO THE ECLIPSE, WINTER-LIKE NIGHTS PERSIST AND REMAIN LONGER THAN USUAL DUE TO POST-ECLIPSE RESIDUAL CONDITIONS.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED CHANGE IN OUTDOOR ILLUMINATION IN A TYPICAL FRIGID MONTH UP TO ONE WEEK AFTER A TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE, LET'S ANALYZE THE SITUATION STEP BY STEP:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 1. **UNDERSTANDING THE NATURAL DAY LENGTH**: IN THE TYPICAL FRIGID MONTH (JANUARY TO MARCH), THE DAYS ARE RELATIVELY SHORT. THIS MEANS THERE'S LESS DAYLIGHT NATURALLY ALREADY DURING THESE MONTHS.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 2. **ECLIPSE VISIBILITY**: THE SOLAR ECLIPSE IS OCCURRING ON MARCH 9TH. THIS MEANS THAT AS MARCH PROGRESSES, THE DAYS WILL GET LONGER (ASSUMING IT'S A TYPICAL FRIGID MONTH, WHERE MARCH GETS LONGER).
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 3. **VISIBILITY AND PHOTOS**: AFTER THE ECLIPSE, PEOPLE WILL TAKE PHOTOS AND SHARE THEM, CREATING ADDITIONAL OUTDOOR ILLUMINATION AS PEOPLE RECALL THE RECENT ECLIPSE EVENT. THIS WILL MAKE DAYS FEEL BRIGHTER.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 4. **SOCIAL IMPACT**: THE EXCITEMENT AND SHARING OF THE ECLIPSE PHOTOS WILL MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO SPEND MORE TIME OUTDOORS, POTENTIALLY INCREASING OVERALL OUTDOOR ACTIVITY.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m **Clarity and Formation**: The question is somewhat clear but struggles with complexity and wordiness. The core idea (expected change in outdoor illumination after a total solar eclipse in a frigid month) is buried under unnecessary details and assumptions.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m **Completeness and Understandability**: While the question attempts to provide context, it introduces ambiguity with mentions of "certain areas, possibly with shorter days in August," which seems irrelevant to the March timeframe.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m **Logical Sense**: The question's premise is logically sound, exploring the impact of a solar eclipse on outdoor illumination.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 1. CONSIDER THE IMMEDIATE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF A RENAL SYSTEM FAILURE:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m    - RENAL FAILURE MEANS THE KIDNEYS ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO FILTER BLOOD EFFECTIVELY.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m    - WITHOUT FUNCTIONING KIDNEYS:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m      - THE BODY CANNOT ELIMINATE TOXINS AND EXCESS FLUIDS.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m      - BLOOD PRESSURE MAY DROP.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m      - WATER RETENTION CAN CAUSE SWELLING IN THE LEGS OR HANDS.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m      - THE LEVELS OF ELECTROLYTES AND MINERALS LIKE SODIUM, POTASSIUM, AND BICARBONATE CAN BECOME IMBALANCED.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m      - THESE IMBALANCES CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS SUCH AS IRREGULAR HEARTBEATS OR MUSCLE SPASMS.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 2. BY FOCUSING ON A SEVERE IMPACT, WE ALSO SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT HAPPENS IF THE RENAL CONDITION DOES NOT IMPROVE WITHIN A WEEK AND TREATMENT IS NOT INITIATED:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m    - IF RENAL FUNCTION HAS NOT RETURNED TO NORMAL WITHIN A WEEK, IT INDICATES THAT THE ORGAN IS NOT RECOVERING.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m    - THIS MEANS THAT THE ORGANS AND BLOOD, UNABLE TO FILTER OUT METABOLIC WASTE, WHICH INCLUDE WASTE PRODUCTS FROM YOUR BODY’S NORMAL CELL FUNCTIONS, BUILD UP.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m    - ONCE PROLONGED, MINERAL IMBALANCES AND FLUID IMBALANCES CAN HAVE SEVERE, LONG-LASTING EFFECTS. YOUR HEART AND OTHER ORGANS COULD CONTINUE TO BE STRESSED AND IMPAIRED.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m GIVEN THIS CONTEXT, LET US RECONSIDER THE OPTIONS PROVIDED:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - OPTION A: "GAS EXCHANGE IN THE LUNGS IS IMPAIRED, BLOOD OXYGENATION FAILS, AND METABOLIC WASTE BUILDS UP IN THE BLOOD."  
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m   - DELAYS IN GAS EXCHANGE AND BLOOD OXYGENATION HAVE DIRECT CAUSES OTHER THAN RENAL FAILURE (E.G., RESPIRATORY ISSUES OR BLOOD LOSS), SO THIS IS NOT THE PRIMARY CONCERN HERE.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - OPTION B: "BLOOD OXYGENATION FAILS, METABOLIC WASTE BUILDS UP IN THE BLOOD, AND ORGANS BEGIN TO MALFUNCTION."  
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m   - ALTHOUGH BLOOD OXYGENATION CAN BE AFFECTED BY ORGAN DYSFUNCTION, THE OPTION SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS ORGANS BEGINNING TO MALFUNCTION, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH FAILURE OF OTHER SYSTEMS.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - OPTION C: "NUTRIENTS ARE UNABLE TO BE TRANSPORTED TO ORGANS, RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS ARE IMPAIRED, AND RENAL FUNCTION RETURNS TO NORMAL."  
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m   - THIS SUGGESTS A RETURN TO NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION WITHIN A WEEK (POST-GIVEN CONDITION), WHICH ISN'T THE ISSUE FOR THE LONG-TERM IMPACT IF FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - OPTION D: "METABOLIC WASTE BUILDS UP IN THE BLOOD, GAS EXCHANGE IN THE LUNGS BEGINS TO IMPROVE, AND ORGANS MAY BEGIN TO MALFUNCTION."  
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m   - THE WASTE ACCUMULATION IS A CONSEQUENCE OF RENAL FAILURE, BUT THE IMPROVEMENT IN GAS EXCHANGE WITH UNRECOGNIZED ORGAN MALFUNCTION IS NOT A LOGICAL PROGRESSION AND COULD BE MISLEADING OR INCORRECT.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m THEREFORE, THE MOST ACCURATE AND COHERENT OPTION THAT DESCRIBES BOTH THE IMMEDIATE SEVERE IMPACT AND THE LONG-TERM SCENARIO ALIGNS WITH THE OPTION THAT OUTLINES SYSTEMIC ORGAN FAILURE DUE TO METABOLIC AND FLUID IMBALANCES:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m THE IMMEDIATE SEVERE IMPACT OF KIDNEY FAILURE WHEN RENAL FUNCTION FAILS IS A COMBINATION OF IMPAIRED GAS EXCHANGE, BLOOD OXYGENATION FAILURE, AND ACCUMULATION OF METABOLIC WASTE IN THE BLOOD.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m THE LONG-TERM IMPACT EXTENDING THIS CONDITION IF RENAL FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN TO NORMAL WITHIN A WEEK IS DISRUPTION AND MALFUNCTION OF ORGANS THROUGH MINERAL AND FLUID IMBALANCES.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m **Clarity and Formation:** The question is somewhat clear but suffers from ambiguity and convolution. It initially asks for the immediate short-term impact of renal system failure but then inquires about the long-term impact without requiring a direct answer to the first question in the response. This dual-question approach within a single query can cause confusion.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m **Completeness and Understandability:** The question provides context about the renal system's failure but does not clearly define what is meant by "severe effects" or the timeframe for "immediate short-term impact."

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m    - IF THE RENAL SYSTEM FAILS SUDDENLY, THE IMMEDIATE SHORT-TERM IMPACT IS SEVERE. THE KIDNEYS FILTER BLOOD, REMOVING WASTE PRODUCTS, EXCESS FLUIDS, AND CONTROLLING ELECTROLYTE BALANCE.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF FAILING RENAL FUNCTION, WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE FUNCTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS AND HOW THEIR FAILURE IMPACTS THE ENTIRE BODY.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE IMMEDIATE SHORT-TERM IMPACT.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - THE KIDNEYS FILTER BLOOD, REMOVING WASTE PRODUCTS AND EXCESS FLUID.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m IF THE RENAL SYSTEM FAILS, THE IMMEDIATE SHORT-TERM IMPACT IS THAT THE BODY CAN NO LONGER CLEANSE ITSELF OF WASTE PRODUCTS THROUGH URINE. THEREFORE, METABOLIC WASTE WILL BUILD UP IN THE BLOOD.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m STEP 2: CONSIDER THE LONG-TERM IMPACT AFTER SEVERAL DAYS IF THE RENAL FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN TO NORMAL WITHIN A WEEK.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - WHEN THE KIDNEYS DO NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY, THEY CANNOT REMOVE WASTE FULLY FROM THE BLOOD.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - THIS ACCUMULATION OF METABOLIC WASTE WILL LEAD TO HARMFUL LEVELS OF SUBSTANCES LIKE SODIUM, POTASSIUM, UREA, AND CREATININE.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - IF TREATMENT IS NOT INITIATED, BLOOD PRESSURE MAY DECREASE SINCE THE KIDNEYS HELP REGULATE FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - AS A RESULT OF THESE IMBALANCES, ORGANS SUCH AS THE HEART, BRAIN, AND MUSCLES MIGHT START TO MALFUNCTION DUE TO THE ACCUMULATION OF HARMFUL METABOLIC WASTE AND ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCES.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - ADDITIONALLY, IF WATER RETENTION DOES NOT PROCEED, DEHYDRATION WILL SET IN QUICKLY.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - AND IF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE CONTINUES, THIS CAN CAUSE PERMANENT ORGAN DAMAGE.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - ORGANS BEGIN TO MALFUNCTION,
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m - ADDITIONALLY, THE ORGANS MIGHT CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE IF LONG-STANDING RENAL FAILURE PERSISTS,

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m CONTEXT: HEALTH: IMPROVING MENTAL WELL-BEING. DEVELOP A STEP-BY-STEP PLAN TO HANDLE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS EFFECTIVELY. A STRONG NEGATIVE MINDSET OFTEN LEADS TO JUDGMENTAL AND CRITICAL THINKING, WHICH CAN HARM RELATIONSHIPS AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. NEGATIVITY CAN BE FUELED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING LOW SELF-ESTEEM, STRESS, AND TOXIC ENVIRONMENTS.

(A) BEGIN BY IDENTIFYING ANY NEGATIVE THOUGHTS, EXPRESS THEM IN A JOURNAL, AND THEN CONSIDER POSITIVE COUNTER-THOUGHTS. IF YOUR FRIEND DISAGREES, DON'T LET IT DISCOURAGE YOU. KEEP TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM UNTIL A RESOLUTION IS REACHED NATURALLY. (B) IDENTIFY THE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS, REFLECT ON THEM IN YOUR MIND, AND THEN EXPOSE THESE THOUGHTS TO A TRUSTED FRIEND TO DISCUSS OPENLY. YOUR FRIEND'S FEEDBACK WILL HELP YOU CHALLENGE AND TRANSFORM THESE THOUGHTS GRADUALLY. (C) IDENTIFY THE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS, EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY TO A FRIEND, AND KEEP A JOURNAL TO RECORD THEM. DURING THE CONVERSATION, USE PROMPTS SUCH AS "IS THIS THOUGHT TRUE? WHAT EVIDENCE DO I HAVE TO SUPPORT THIS THOUGHT? DO I BENEFIT FROM THIS THOUGHT? IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE OR DIFFERENT WAY TO VIEW THIS SITUATION? LASTLY, SHARE WITH A PEER OR MENTOR WHO CAN GUIDE YOU IN UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTING YOUR THOUGHTS. (D) KEEP A JOURNAL, REFLECT ON EACH NEGATIVE THOUGHT IN ISOLATION, AND THEN REACT WITH ANGER TOWARDS A FRIEND WHO BRINGS THESE THOUGHTS UP. DEVELOP A SELF-COMPASSIONATE ATTITUDE AND UTILIZE MEDITATION TO ACHIEVE A CALM MINDSET.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m EXPLANATION:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m OPTION (C) IS THE MOST SUITABLE AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO GUIDE SOMEONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RECOGNIZING, CHALLENGING, AND TRANSFORMING NEGATIVE THOUGHTS IN A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS. THIS APPROACH PROVIDES A STRUCTURED, STEP-BY-STEP PLAN THAT ALIGNS WITH THE TECHNIQUE OF COGNITIVE THERAPY, WHICH IS WELL-SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH FOR IMPROVING MENTAL WELL-BEING.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m HERE'S AN IN-DEPTH BREAKDOWN OF THIS OPTION:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 1. **IDENTIFY NEGATIVE THOUGHTS:** CLEARLY, THE FIRST STEP INVOLVES IDENTIFYING NEGATIVE THOUGHTS, WHICH INVOLVES OBSERVATION AND SELF-AWARENESS. THIS IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE NEGATIVE THOUGHT IS, THERE'S NO WAY TO CHALLENGE OR TRANSFORM IT.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m    
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 2. **EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY AND KEEP A JOURNAL:** EXPRESSING THESE THOUGHTS VERBALLY TO A FRIEND ALLOWS FOR OPEN AND HONEST COMMUNICATION. SHARING WITH A TRUSTED FRIEND CAN PROVIDE SOLIDARITY AND NEW PERSPECTIVES. WRITING THESE THOUGHTS DOWN IN A JOURNAL PROMOTES MENTAL HEALTH BY REDUCING STRESS AND ALLOWING FOR A CLEAR RECORD OF THE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS OVER TIME.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 3. **USE PROMPTS FOR TRANSFORMATION:** UTILIZING PROMPTS SUCH AS "IS THIS THOUGHT TRUE? WHAT EVIDENCE DO I HAVE TO SUPPORT THIS THOUGHT? DO I BENEFIT FROM THIS THOUGHT? IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE OR DIFFERENT WAY TO VIEW THIS SITUATION?" ORGANIZES THE PROCESS OF CHALLENGING AND TRANSFORMING NEGATIVE THOUGHTS. IT GUIDES THE PERSON TOWARDS A MORE ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING AND CONSTRUCTIVE REFLECTION.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 4. **SEEK GUIDANCE FROM A PEER OR MENTOR:** ENGAGING WITH A PEER OR MENTOR, WHO MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCED OR FAMILIAR WITH THE SAME EXPERIENCE, PROVIDES ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL SUPPORT. THIS MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND SHARED PERSPECTIVE CAN VALIDATE THE INDIVIDUAL'S FEELINGS AND HELP PREEMPT CONFUSION, DEEPENING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SELF-REFLECTION PROCESS.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m OPTION (A) IS FLAWED BECAUSE IT INTRODUCES THE NOTION OF PEER DISCUSSIONS WITHOUT A PREDICTABLE OR CONSISTENT GUIDELINE. OPTION (B) REQUIRES PROACTIVELY SEEKING FEEDBACK FROM A FRIEND, WHICH MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE, AND RELIES SOLELY ON THE FRIEND'S REACTION. OPTION (D) IS LESS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT INTRODUCES SOCIETAL CONFLICT AND THE SUPPRESSION OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS, WHICH DOES NOT FACILITATE MENTAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m THEREFORE, OPTION (C) IS THE MOST COHERENT AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION THAT MANAGES THE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS PROCESS THROUGH PEER DISCUSSIONS AND STRUCTURED PROMPTS.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m  Use the following context to answer the question.         ## Context:         In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills. In particular, Medication Therapy Management (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients. Such services include the thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual. The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.          ## Question:         What is included in Medication Therapy Management?          Let's think step by step.

A strong negative mindset often leads to judgmental and critical thinking, which can harm relationships and personal development. Negativity can be fueled by various factors, including low self-esteem, stress, and toxic environments. To combat this, one should develop strategies to recognize, challenge, and transform negative thoughts into constructive reflections.

(A) Begin by identifying any negative thoughts, express them in a journal, and then consider positive counter-thoughts. If your friend disagrees, don't let it discourage you. Keep trying to express them until a resolution is reached naturally. (B) Identify the negative thoughts, reflect on them in your mind, and then expose these thoughts to a trusted friend to discuss openly. Your friend's feedback will help you challenge and transform these thoughts gradually. (C) Identify the negative thoughts, express them verbally to a friend, and keep a journal to record them. During the conversation, use prompts such as "Is this thought true? What evidence do I have to support this thought? Do I benefit from this thought? Is there any alternative or different way to view this situation? Lastly, share with a peer or mentor who can guide you in understanding and accepting your thoughts. (D) Keep a journal, reflect on each negative thought in isolation, and then react with anger towards a friend who brings these thoughts up. Develop a self-compassionate attitude and utilize meditation to achieve a calm mindset.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m The reference task involves understanding the positive aspects of every situation to shift one's mindset towards positivity. However, the original task is relatively straightforward, requiring knowledge acquisition and simple decision making based on provided options. To increase the complexity, I will add additional constraints, introduce multi-step dependencies, and include distractors. Specifically, I will modify the task to involve a logical sequence of actions based on identifying and responding to negative thoughts.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m Context: Health: Improving Mental Well-being. Develop a step-by-step plan to handle negative thoughts effectively. A strong negative mindset often leads to judgmental and critical thinking, which can harm relationships and personal development. Negativity can be fueled by various factors, including low self-esteem, stress, and toxic environments. To combat this, one should develop strategies to recognize, challenge, and transform negative thoughts into constructive reflections.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m Given the following four options, which represents the most coherent and effective plan that guides a person through the process of recognizing, challenging, and transforming negative thoughts in a series of conversations with friends? (A) Begin by identifying any negative thoughts, express them in a journal, and then consider positive counter-thoughts. If your friend disagrees, don't let it discourage you. Keep trying to express them until a resolution is reached naturally. (B) Identify the negative thoughts, reflect on them in your mind, and then expose these thoughts to a trusted friend to discuss openly. Your friend's feedback will help you challenge and transform these thoughts gradually. (C) Identify the negative thoughts, express them verbally to a friend, and keep a journal to record them. During the conversation, use prompts such as "Is this thought true? What evidence do I have to support this thought? Do I benefit from this thought? Is there any alternative or different way to view this situation? Lastly, share with a peer or mentor who can guide you in understanding and accepting your thoughts. (D) Keep a journal, reflect on each negative thought in isolation, and then react with anger towards a friend who brings these thoughts up. Develop a self-compassionate attitude and utilize meditation to achieve a calm mindset.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m Notice that the first test case should not be accepted as a valid right-angled triangle because the sides involve a Pythagorean triplet in a different combination (i.e., 10^2 + 6^2 = 8^2). Similarly, the second test avoids the common 3-4-5 triplets. For the third test, make sure the function returns an error message if the sides do not form a right-angled triangle. Moreover, the function should verify the triangle is not an isosceles right-angled triangle. The solution must return an error for this case. In addition, implement the function `is_triangle(a, b, c)` to determine whether the given triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. If the given triangle is isosceles right-angled, then the function should return False and print an error message. The function should first check if the triangle is isosceles right-angled and then check if it is a right-angled triangle. The check function should also verify if the given sides form a Pythagorean triplet (a^2 + b^2 = c^2 or c^2 = a^2 + b^2). If it's neither, then the function should raise an error. For the following test cases:

It is here that the Rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries, such as the Neckar, the Main and, later, the Moselle, which contributes an average discharge of more than 300 m3/s (11,000 cu ft/s). Northeastern France drains to the Rhine via the Moselle; smaller rivers drain the Vosges and Jura Mountains uplands. Most of Luxembourg and a very small part of Belgium also drain to the Rhine via the Moselle. As it approaches the Dutch border, the Rhine has an annual mean discharge of 2,290 m3/s (81,000 cu ft/s) and an average width of 400 m (1,300 ft).          ## Question:         Which of the tributaries in Germany contributes most?

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m The modified version of the question involves understanding the rule and correctly applying it, thus testing deeper logical reasoning. Additionally, the problem introduces a new character (Madison Grey) who is already controlling Sydney Carter. The character-matching and advanced roll-consideration are multi-step, making it significantly harder than the original trivial question. To reach the answer, one needs to consider the constraints again and count the advancing possibilities according to the rules. ```<think>
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m In the original reference, the challenge was essentially a simple factual recall question about a TV show character. The new task removes that straightforwardness entirely by introducing a complex game scenario with multiple characters and rules. The goal is to determine the number of ways a game can advance under specific rules, which requires careful analysis and adherence to logical constraints.

[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m In the game "Poweropolis", there are six main characters: Madison Grey, Jason White, Marla Camden, Bradley Casey, Grant Ross, and Sydney Carter. Rolling a standard six-sided die determines the advancement of a character based on the roll:
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 1. Characters controlled by Madison Grey and Marla Camden can advance on rolls of 2 or 4.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 2. Marla Camden is immune to rules outside her control.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 3. Characters controlled by Jason White can advance on roll of 3 or 5.
[36m(main_task pid=3487614)[0m 4. Characters under Grant Ross cannot roll to advance.
